# Instructions

When a user loads the website they will be directed to a landing page, which will then route to the list of products available. When any of the products are selected they will be routed to a detailed description of that product. The detailed product will have an option to add or remove that item from the cart. When a user clicks on the cart button they will see a list of all selected products in that cart. When the user is ready to purchase they will submit that order and be returned to the products page.
